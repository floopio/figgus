# figgus

A Clojure library that handles reading configuration from json files (locally and remotely) and allowing system property overrides.

## Usage

#### Leiningen

    [io.floop/figgus "0.1.0"]

#### Using it

By default figgus looks for a file named `config.json`, this can be set to anything else by setting the `figgus.config` system property. It can even be a URL, as long as it points to JSON.

    (:require [figgus.core :as fig])
    (fig/get "some.property.name" "default-value")
    (fig/get "some.other.property")

#### Reloading configuration

You can atomically reload the configuration by invoking the `load-config` function.

    (load-config)
    
This will re-load the config from the last location it was loaded. This function also accepts a parameter specifying a new location to load the configuration from.

#### Environment variables

Environment variables can be used to override system properties and configuration values, the caveat here is that they are in upper case and have the `.` substituted with a `_`.

For example: The system property `figgus.config` could be overridden with the environment variable `FIGGUS_CONFIG`.

The order of evaluation is:

    Environment Variable -> System Property -> Configuration File -> Default Value (if provided)

#### Properties

Properties specified in the configuration location will be the type that they are in the file (integer, string, map, vector).

Properties are referenced by using a `.` delimiter, as you can see with the property `prop-map.prop2.prop3` in the example below; `get`ing `prop-map.prop2` will return you the map that is `prop2`.

Property names that contain a `.` are not yet supported.

    {
        "prop-int": 200,
        "prop-str": "aaa",
        "prop-vec": ["a", "b", "c", "d"],
        "prop-map": {
            "nested-prop": "bbb",
            "prop2": {
                "prop3": "ccc"
            }
        }
    }
